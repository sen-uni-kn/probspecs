class ProbabilityBounds(Named, ConfigContainer):
    """
    Computes a sequence of refined bounds on a probability.
    The :code:`bound` method produces a generator yielding lower and upper bounds
    on a :code:`Probability` term.
    The lower and upper bounds that this generator yields improve with successive
    yields, meaning that the lower bound increases while the upper bound decreases.
    In any case, the bounds are guaranteed (up to floating point error)
    to contain the actual probability.

    To refine the previously computed bounds, :code:`ProbabilityBounds` performs
    branch and bound with input splitting.
    There are various heuristics that the algorithm can use to select
    splits and branches.

    Split Heuristics:
     - :code:`"smart-branching"`: smart branching with IBP or CROWN.
       Split the dimension that leads to the best estimated bounds.
       The bounding method to use can be selected using the additional
       :code:`auto_lirpa_method` parameter (default is `"IBP"`).
       You can specify this parameter using the :code:`split_heuristic_params`
       argument.
       This heuristic has an additional parameter :code:`better_branch`
       that determines which branch that results from a split is selected
       to evaluate the split.
       By default (:code:`better_branch=True`), a split is evaluated using the
       bounds of the resulting branch with the better bounds.
       When :code:`better_branch=False`, instead the branch with the worse bounds
       is used.
       This is the strategy of BaBSR [BunelEtAl2020]_.
     - :code:`prob-weighted-smart-branching`: As smart branching, but computes
       the probability masses in each split and weights the bounds by the probability
       masses of the splits when selecting a branch.
     - :code:`"longest-edge"`: Split the dimension that has the largest diameter.
       By default, this strategy normalizes the diameters to the diameters of the
       initial variable bounds for each variable.
       This is to make sure that the algorithm does not concentrate on splitting one
       variable with a large initial diameter.
       You can turn off normalization by setting the split heuristic parameter
       :code:`normalize=False`.
     - :code:`"normalized-longest-edge"`: Split the dimension that has the largest
       diameter, where the diameter of each dimension is normalized by the initial
       diameter of the dimension.
       This variant of longest edge splitting is recommended for input spaces whose
       dimensions have different scales.
     - :code:`"random"`: Randomly selects a dimension to split.

    Branch Selection Heuristics:
     - :code:`"prob-mass"`: Split the branches with the largest probability mass in them.
     - :code:`"bounds"`: Selects the branch with the smallest lower or largest upper bounds
       (whichever is farther from zero).
       This broadly resembles the branch selection strategy from [BunelEtAl2020]_.
     - :code:`"prob-and-tight-bounds"`. Combines bounds and probabilities by multiplication.
       Broadly, the goal is to select the branch with the largest probability mass
       and the tightest bounds, searching for branches with high probability mass that
       are likely to be pruned soon.
       Concretely, we compute the distance between a lower and an upper bound,
       normalize this distance to [0.0, 1.0], subtract from one (so that
       tight bounds get large values) and multiply by the probability mass.
       We select the branches with the largest product of normalized bounds and
       probability masses.
     - :code:`"prob-and-log-bounds"`: As :code:`"prob-and-tight-bounds"`, but instead
       of normalizing the distances to [0.0, 1.0], we compute 1 / ln(distance + 2).
       This is then multiplied with the probability mass.
       The resulting product values are used to select branches.
       The idea here is to split based on probability mass when bounds are loose
       and take them into consideration when they are relatively tight.
     - :code:`"prob-and-loose-bounds"`: As :code:`"prob-and-tight-bounds"`, but
       prioritizes branches with high probability mass and loose bounds.

        Select input dimensions to split.
        :code:`smart_branching` selects the dimension (for each batch element)
        that leads to the largest improvement in the estimated lower or upper bound
        of the satisfaction function when split.
        The improvements in lower and upper bounds are estimated using the
        bounding algorithm :code:`method`.
        You should select a cheap bounding algorithm, such as IBP for this task.
        This split strategy is an adaption of BaBSR from [BunelEtAl2020]_.

        The algorithm to compute bounds can be selected using the
        :code:`auto_lirpa_method` split heuristic parameter.

        Each split is evaluated either by selecting the branch resulting from the split
        that has the better or worse bounds.
        Which is selected is determined by the :code:`better_branch`
        split heuristic parameter.
        By default, the better bounds are used, but using the worse bounds may lead to
        a more balanced branching tree.
