    "Interesting background on the gender-related economic situation in West Germany in the 1970s\n",

    "on the unadjusted and adjusted gender pay gap for Germany by Friederike Maier.\n",
    "https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=50202\n",
    "Concretely, we use the reported 1977 distributions for West Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EGGE reports the fraction of full-time employed women as 24.63% in 1977.\n",
    "This is in contrast to the surplus of women in the general population in West Germany.\n",
    "Women are reported to make up 52.6% of the overall population in West Germany in 1975 \n",
    "according to the United Nations (https://population.un.org/wpp/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For marital status, we did not find data split by gender.\n",
    "Therefore, we model marital status independent of gender and use the\n",
    "1970/1971 distribution from Statista for West Germany.\n",
    "https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1059366/umfrage/zahl-der-einwohner-nach-familienstand-in-deutschland/\n",
    "The distribution is: 24 million people single, \n",
    "30.3 million married people (only age group 15-64), 5.2 million widowed, \n",
    "1.1 million separated.\n",
    "According to the United Nations (https://population.un.org/wpp/), the overall\n",
    "population of West Germany in 1970 was 78.2 million, including East Germany.\n",
    "With the total population reported by Statista for West and East Germany\n",
    "being 77.7 million, we assume the missing 1.1 million individuals are\n",

    "The population of West Germany makes up 78.0% of the total german population\n",
